                    <p class="lead" style="text-align: justify;">As an automotive professional, I have gathered in my
                        15+ years of professional life various experiences.
                        Starting as a technician in a Fiat / Alfa Romeo / Maserati workshop in my hometown Bucharest, I
                        have
                        gathered
                        much hands-on experience in servicing cars. This experience would later help me better
                        understand the
                        workflows
                        and processes within a workshop. I applied this experience while taking various roles within the
                        company,
                        from
                        warranty consultant to service advisor. In my role as a service advisor, I had the privilege of
                        interacting
                        with
                        various customers (normal customers, fleet customers, international customers, etc.). Discussing
                        with
                        customers,
                        finding solutions to their problems, managing their expectations and the demands of the
                        workshop, I was able
                        to
                        improve dramatically some of my skills: time management, problem solving, and customer
                        relations.</p>

                    <p class="lead" style="text-align: justify;">Being thirsty of new challenges and willing to further
                        develop myself, I managed to get a job
                        with Renault
                        Service Roumanie, a sister company for Renault France. I started there as a warranty analyst for
                        Switzerland
                        and
                        climbed up the ladder becoming after a short time Team Manager for the German-speaking
                        countries, Italy and
                        Spain. I had to manage a team of 10 people and I was in charge with all quality, quantity and
                        financial
                        KPIâ€™s of
                        the warranty and technical assistance activities. Interacting with my colleagues from other
                        countries helped
                        me
                        refine my management skills.</p>

                    <p class="lead" style="text-align: justify;">The move to Abu Dhabi Motors came as a normal step in
                        my desire to have an international career.
                        I joined the
                        famous Abu Dhabi Motors (biggest BMW, MINI and Rolls Royce dealer at that time) as a team leader
                        in the
                        workshop. It was back to the tools but an experience I will never forget. Having to manage more
                        than 25
                        people
                        of various cultures and backgrounds has helped me improve further my people management skills,
                        and my time
                        management skills, as well as getting used to working in a very fast-paced environment. The 2.5
                        years
                        working
                        there played a major role in my development both professionally as personally.</p>

                    <p class="lead" style="text-align: justify;">Coming back to Europe, joining Renault Germany as a
                        warranty team leader allowed me to put into
                        practice all
                        my
                        knowledge gathered from previous experiences. During this time I further developed my skills in
                        areas such
                        as
                        customer relations, and budget follow-up. My data analysis skills, my desire to improve
                        processes and
                        procedures
                        and my constant focus on customer satisfaction allowed me to decrease drastically the time
                        needed to answer
                        to
                        dealer requests.</p>

                    <p class="lead" style="text-align: justify;">Keeping up with the automotive trend, I joined the
                        electric hype and ventured into the world of
                        start-ups.
                        First
                        joining Vinfast Europe and later Fisker Europe, I was able to learn new things and further
                        develop myself.
                        My
                        experience as a technician from the beginning of my professional life helped me set-up the
                        service network
                        for
                        both start-ups. Putting to good use my time management skills, my technical skills as well as
                        having a
                        ferocious
                        desire to perform and do things as good as possible, allowed me to finish all assigned projects
                        within the
                        allocated timeline and budget.</p>

                    <p class="lead" style="text-align: justify;">I am passionate about learning new things and applying
                        my know-how to solve complex challenges
                        and deliver
                        innovative solutions. I have leveraged my skills and certifications in Microsoft Power Automate
                        and LinkedIn
                        Learning to streamline workflows, automate tasks, and enhance my professional development.</p>
